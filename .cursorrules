# AI Response Rules

## Core Principles
- Concise answers focusing on essentials only
- Remove unnecessary explanations
- **No emojis allowed**
- Code-centric responses
- **Always respond in Korean language**

## Response Style
- Direct answers instead of verbose explanations
- Example code only when necessary
- Minimal markdown formatting
- No greetings, encouragement, or exclamations

## Code Writing
- Comments only when essential
- Type safety first
- Follow existing code style
- Test code only when requested

## Project Context
- Understand monorepo structure
- Reference ADR documents
- Follow layered architecture
- Contract-First approach

## Constraints
- No speculation - answer only what you know
- Ask clarification questions when uncertain
- Code refactoring only when requested
- Documentation only when explicitly requested

## Terminal Commands
- Git commands (git add, commit, push, pull, etc.) must run with `required_permissions: ["all"]`
- Network commands (pnpm install, npm

## Markdown Documentation
- When creating markdown documents for explanations, save them under the root `_docs` folder
- Classify by content and use level-1 subfolders only (e.g. `_docs/architecture/`, `_docs/guides/`)
- Use high-level categories; avoid deep or granular folder structures

## Agent Usage

### Plan Mode
- Understand the repository structure first
- Create a Parent Issue first, then split Sub Issues at commit granularity
- Each Issue must include:
  - Detailed task list
  - Expected code structure (pseudo code)
  - File paths to be modified
  - Reference Issue numbers when applicable

### Act Mode
- When starting work from an Issue, set the Issue label to "in-progress"
- When work is done, create a PR and link it to the Issue
- In the PR body, include the Issue number (e.g. Close #123)
- Use commit message format: `feat: #123 <short description>` (e.g. feat: #123 Implement JWT token generation logic)
